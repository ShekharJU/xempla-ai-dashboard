These could include:\n\u2705 For Energy Efficiency:\n\n    Power consumption logs (in Watts or kWh)\n\n    Idle vs active time of machine/device\n\n    Output per unit of energy consumed\n\n    Benchmark/ideal energy usage under same conditions\n\n\u2705 For Safety:\n\n    Sensor logs (e.g., temperature, pressure, motion)\n\n    Frequency of hazard or near-miss events\n\n    Historical data of failures or maintenance\n\n    Real-time alerts from safety protocols\n\n\u2699\ufe0f 2. Data Preprocessing\n\nRaw data must be cleaned and transformed:\n\n    Remove noise or outliers (e.g., sensor spikes)\n\n    Normalize values to standard ranges\n\n    Aggregate data over time (e.g., hourly average power)\n\n    Label events if classification is used (for ML-based systems)\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 3. Algorithm or Rule-based Evaluation\n\ud83d\udfe2 For % Energy Efficient:\n\nFormula (Basic):\n\n% Energy Efficient = (Ideal energy usage / Actual energy usage) * 100\n\nExample (Simplified):\n\n    A motor ideally uses 500 kWh per month\n\n    In practice, it uses 600 kWh\n\n    Efficiency = (500 / 600) \u00d7 100 = 83.33%\n\nAlternatively:\n\n    Use regression models (e.g., predict energy required based on load), then compare actual vs predicted.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 For % Safety:\n\nDefine a safety scoring system.\n\nExample Rule-Based Score:\n\n    0 incidents = 100% safe\n\n    1 warning = -10%, 1 minor fault = -20%, 1 major fault = -50%\n\nTotal:\n\n% Safety = 100% - \u03a3 (penalty scores)\n\nMachine Learning Approach:\n\n    Train a classification model to predict \"safe\" vs \"unsafe\" situations\n\n    Use confidence probability of \"safe\" class as % safety\n\n\ud83e\udde0 4. Interpretation & Output Layer\nOutput Format:\n\n{\n  \"energy_efficiency\": \"83.33%\",\n  \"safety_score\": \"92.5%\",\n  \"risk_level\": \"Low\",\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\n    \"Reduce standby energy consumption\",\n    \"Schedule equipment inspection - vibration detected\"\n  ]\n}\n\nOptionally, use color codes:\n\n    Green: >90% safe/efficient\n\n    Yellow: 70\u201390%\n\n    Red: <70%",
